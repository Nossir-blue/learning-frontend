This repo is to save all my projects, lessons and exercises
I am not necessarily a noob in frontend, it's just that i learned just for the sake of having something on my resume
i never really tried doing something with these 3 basic technologies.

I am always doing random stuff on random languages just for the sake of having "i know this language" on my resume

So now i am relearning frontend, i'll even pick up react once i feel comfortable doing things with html, css and js
